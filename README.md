# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office

This project aims to apply the skills learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. 
The objective of this project is to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

By doing this project I gained experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. 
This will allow Data Analysts and Data Scientists to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots created from the data.
